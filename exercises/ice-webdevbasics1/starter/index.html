  <h2> Instructions </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> <strong>Cook Meat with Vegetables</strong> : In a large pot, cook the ground beef, diced onion, and diced bell
      pepper over
      medium
      heat until the meat is no longer pink and the vegetables are softened. </li>
    <li> <strong>Add Remaining Ingredients</strong>: To the pot, add the kidney beans, diced tomatoes (with their
      juice), chili powder,
      ground cumin, and salt to taste. If the chili is too thick, add a little water to reach your desired consistency.
    </li>

    <li> <strong> Simmer </strong>: Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 20-30
      minutes to allow the
      flavors
      to meld. Stir occasionally. </li>

    <li> <strong>Serve</strong>: Enjoy your chili as is, or with toppings like shredded cheese or sour cream. </li>
  </ol>
